### Hello! My name is Zayeed (Za-eed), and I code, go figure.
I am a freshmen high school student, and I like Physics, Math & Games. Totally the nerd you usually despise, *usually*.
I usually code in Python for Data Science & C# with Unity. Currently Learning C++.

Personal Goals:
* Learning C++
* Making a proper game with Unity
* Learning robotics
